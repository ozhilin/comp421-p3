4 beds + 2 couches. Impeccably maintained property. Steps away from parks, all services and public transportation. Beautiful quiet backyard with wooden deck and an outside spa. Stunning bathroom with a separate glass shower.

Reviews:
I was extremely happy with this room and the location. The view was beautiful and we were close to all of the attractions in Toronto. From the time that we were let into the building until we left, it felt like home.
